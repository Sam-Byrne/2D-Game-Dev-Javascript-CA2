# 2D-Game-Dev-Javascript-CA2
The repo for the CA2 of 2D Game Development where I make an educational earthquake game that hopefully works
More info on the game: A short educational reaction game that teaches children the earthquake safety procedure "Drop -> Cover -> Hold On" using clear and easily readable prompts and facts about each step of the procedure.
The intention is to teach kids on what to do during an earthquake so they keep themselves and others as safe as possible.
This project runs on HTML / Javascript

HOW TO PLAY
to play download and unzip the file, then go through the folders until you find Index.html. Clicking this file will play the game.

Unfortunately I could not figure out how to get everything to work and the game does not function
