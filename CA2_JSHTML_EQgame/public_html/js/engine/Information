DROP 

What to do: Drop to your hands and knees as soon as the ground begins to tremble.
This prevents the shaking from pushing you about or causing you to tumble.

Why: If you remain upright, you run the risk of falling or being struck by walls, furniture, or other objects. You stay more stable when you become low.



COVER

What to do: Crawl beneath any nearby strong tables or desks.
Hold onto the leg of the table and remain near.
Put your face towards your knees and cover your head and neck with your arms if there isn't a table.

Why: The safest technique to protect your body is to cover yourself with something sturdy since falling objects can strike your head or shoulders.


HOLD ON

What to do: Hold onto the table or desk with one hand while covering your head with the other.
If you don’t have a table, just keep your hands on your head and neck.
Stay where you are until the shaking completely stops.

Why: The shaking can last a few seconds to a minute. Holding on keeps you from moving around and getting hurt.





EXTRA TIPS:

Stay inside until the earthquake is over, it is much safer inside!

Try to avoid heavy furniture and glass objects such as windows and mirrors as they may fall over or shatter into many painful pieces.

If you are outside during an earthquake, try to go somewhere which has the least buildings, trees and anything else taller than you around.

After an earthquake subsides, there may be aftershocks which are smaller mini earthquakes that can happen over an extended amount of time.
